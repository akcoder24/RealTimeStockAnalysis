# Real Time Stock Analysis using LSTM

Real-time stock prediction analysis using LSTM is a machine learning technique that is used to forecast future stock prices based on historical data. LSTM stands for Long Short-Term Memory, which is a type of recurrent neural network that is well-suited for processing sequential data, such as stock prices.

The real-time stock prediction analysis using LSTM involves collecting historical stock data, cleaning and processing the data, and then training an LSTM model on the data. The trained model is then used to make predictions about future stock prices, which can be used by investors and traders to make informed decisions
